# Simple sketching project implemented with JavaScript
Branch for implementing choice of color and scaling.

Both drawing and background colors can be chosen, also on touch screen devices.

Three scales are implemented (8x8, 16x16 and 32x32).

Idea by The Odin Project (Etch-a-Sketch assignment), with some added touch screen functionality.

Colors by [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/).
